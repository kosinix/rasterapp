# Image Rescaling and Interpolation Algorithms

Image rescaling is the resizing of digital images. You see it in action almost everywhere, from your phone to your computer. When you edit an image in image editing softwares (iOS Photos, Photoshop, GIMP) or When you zoom in on an image in your phone, it is image rescaling at work. 

But how does it work?

 To easily visualize rescaling, we will think of pixels as tiny rectangles.  Pixels are the smallest unit of an image. 

When an image is enlarged, the number of pixels are increased. When it is reduced, the number of pixels are decreased. 

Lets take for example a 2x2 image. That is an image, 2 pixel width and 2 pixel height.A 2x2 pixel, is made up of 4 tiny rectangles, as pictured below:
